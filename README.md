## Walmart Report Analysis

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the airlines understand their customers better. It helps the stakeholders know about their customers completely about their interest. Through different analysis, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their services by identifying these area. 

### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.
- Step 3 : Also since by default, profile will be opened only for 1000 rows so you need to select "column profiling based on entire dataset".
- Step 4 : It was observed that in none of the columns errors & empty values were present except column named "item weight" because the data is unavailable.
- Step 5 : And then added different slicers like:
- Location
- Product Type
- Ratings.
- Outlet size. 

After added all the information analyzed complete information like:

- Total sales.
- Average sales.
- Total items sold.
- Average ratings.
- Sum of sales by item type.
- Sales by outlet type.
- Growth of outlets by years.
- Sales of items by fat content.
- Finally did my correlation between item fat content, store type, item visibility & sales.

With all the visulizations I achived analysis of complete data like Highest sales item, Lowest sales item, Popular location and more.
